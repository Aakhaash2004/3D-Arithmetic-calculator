# 3D-Arithmetic-calculator
VAC project
In this project, our goal is to create a functional and aesthetically pleasing
calculator with a 3D effect using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calculator will
have a standard layout with buttons for numbers, mathematical operations, and a
display for the results. Our aim is to create a unique user experience that will
engage users and make performing mathematical calculations an enjoyable task.
The calculator will be designed to have a 3D effect, with buttons that appear to
pop out from the surface of the calculator. When a button is clicked, it will appear
to depress slightly, giving the user feedback that the button has been pressed.
This effect will add a visual appeal to the calculator, making it more attractive and
fun to use.
To create the 3D effect, we will use CSS transformations to rotate and skew the
buttons. We will also use box shadows and gradients to create the appearance of
depth. The use of CSS transformations will allow us to manipulate the position of
the buttons in three dimensions, giving them a realistic and interactive
appearance.
The calculator will be functional, allowing users to perform basic mathematical
operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It will also
have buttons for clearing the display and for entering decimal points. We will
ensure that the calculator can handle both simple and complex calculations,
making it an ideal tool for both basic and advanced users.
To ensure that the calculator is accessible, we will use appropriate ARIA attributes
and keyboard support. This will make it easy for users with disabilities to access
and use the calculator. We will also make the calculator responsive, which means
that it will automatically adjust to the size of the device it is viewed on. This
feature will ensure that the calculator is usable on a wide range of devices,
including desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones.
To implement the calculator, we will use HTML to define the structure of the
calculator, CSS to style the calculator, and JavaScript to add interactivity to the
calculator. We will use event listeners to detect button clicks and update the
display accordingly. The use of JavaScript will make the calculator more dynamic
and interactive, providing a more engaging user experience.
In summary, our project involves creating a 3D calculator that is both aesthetically
pleasing and functional using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calculator will have a
unique appearance that will engage users and make performing mathematical
calculations an enjoyable task. We will ensure that the calculator is accessible and
responsive, making it usable on a wide range of devices. Our goal is to create a
user-friendly and interactive calculator that will provide an exceptional user
experience.
